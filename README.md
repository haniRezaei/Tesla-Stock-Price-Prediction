Tesla Stock Price Forecasting Using LSTM
This project demonstrates how to predict Tesla's stock prices using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network model.

Forecast the closing price of Tesla stocks using past values. The dataset includes Teslaâ€™s historical stock prices from 2010 to 2020. The goal is to build a model that learns from past price behavior and generalizes well to unseen future prices.

We use an LSTM-based neural network trained on the last 20 days (lookback = 20) of normalized closing prices.

Input: Sequences of 20 historical stock prices

Output: Forecast of the next day's price

Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Optimizer: Adam

Model Evaluation: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and loss curves

Training RMSE: ~13.12 USD

Test RMSE: ~29.85 USD


While the model performs well on the training set, it starts to diverge slightly during high-volatility periods (late 2019), which is expected in time series forecasting.
